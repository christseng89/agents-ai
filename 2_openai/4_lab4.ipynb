       "\n",
       "- **LangChain**: A Python-based framework enabling developers to build applications that integrate large language models (LLMs) with external tools and data sources. It supports various LLMs and offers a modular design for creating complex workflows. ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40elisowski/top-ai-agent-frameworks-in-2025-9bcedab2e239?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **AutoGen**: Developed by Microsoft, AutoGen facilitates the creation of multi-agent systems where agents communicate in natural language to perform tasks collaboratively. It includes built-in agents and a graphical interface for prototyping. ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40elisowski/top-ai-agent-frameworks-in-2025-9bcedab2e239?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **CrewAI**: Focuses on role-based task execution, allowing agents to assume specific roles (e.g., researcher, writer) to collaboratively complete complex workflows. It's particularly useful for team-oriented applications. ([odsc.medium.com](https://odsc.medium.com/top-10-open-source-ai-agent-frameworks-to-know-in-2025-c739854ec859?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **LangGraph**: An extension of LangChain, LangGraph introduces a graph-based system for managing data flow between agents, supporting branching, looping, and conditional flows, making it suitable for applications requiring dynamic decision-making. ([phyniks.com](https://phyniks.com/blog/top-7-agentic-ai-frameworks-in-2025?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Eliza**: A Web3-friendly AI agent operating system that integrates seamlessly with blockchain applications, enabling the deployment of AI agents in decentralized environments. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06781?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
