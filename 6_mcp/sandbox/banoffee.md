# Banoffee Pie Recipe

## Ingredients
- 1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk (to make caramel)
- 1 ready-made digestive biscuit crust (or homemade)
- 3-4 ripe bananas
- 300 ml double cream
- 2 tbsp icing sugar

## Instructions
1. **Make the caramel:**
   - Remove the label from the can of sweetened condensed milk.
   - Place the unopened can in a pot of boiling water, ensuring it's fully submerged, and boil for about 2-3 hours. Keep topping up water to keep the can covered.
   - Alternatively, cook the condensed milk in a saucepan on low heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens and turns golden.
   - Let the caramel cool completely.

2. **Prepare the crust:**
   - Fill the digestive biscuit crust with the cooled caramel.

3. **Add bananas:**
   - Slice the bananas and layer them evenly over the caramel.

4. **Whip the cream:**
   - Whip the double cream with the icing sugar until soft peaks form.
   - Spread the whipped cream over the banana layer.

5. **Garnish and serve:**
   - Sprinkle chocolate shavings or dust cocoa powder on top.
   - Chill the pie in the refrigerator for at least an hour before serving.
