# SaaS product that uses MCP for external integration.

## ✅ Scenario: Compliance Check SaaS

Imagine you operate:

> **AcmeCompliance SaaS**
>
> * Provides compliance checks (e.g. AML/KYC, sanctions screening, regulatory rules)
> * Sells access to external clients (banks, fintechs, enterprises)
> * Wants to integrate with partner LLMs or agent platforms

You decide:

> → **Expose an external MCP Server.**

Partners can then:

* connect their LLM agents to your MCP Server
* pass an API key for authentication
* submit natural-language compliance requests
* receive structured compliance results

✅ **Exactly like an API — but in MCP form.**

---

## ✅ How it Works (Architecture)

```
[ Partner LLM Agent ]
          │
          ▼
      MCP Client
          │
          │ (API_KEY token in payload)
          ▼
    ➡️ [ Your External MCP Server ]
          │
          │
   Internal API Call
          │
          ▼
   [ AcmeCompliance SaaS backend ]
```

* Partners connect to your MCP server over:

  * SSE (hosted scenario)
  * or stdio (local install)
* Each call includes an API token.
* Your MCP server:

  * authenticates the token
  * forwards the request to your real SaaS API endpoints
  * returns a structured result back to the partner’s agent

This way:
✅ Partners never see your SaaS API’s private details.
✅ You control usage via the token.
✅ You can throttle, rate-limit, and audit calls.

---

## ✅ Concrete Example

Suppose a partner wants:

> “Check if company Acme Widgets is on the OFAC sanctions list.”

Instead of writing custom API code, they can simply call your MCP tool:

---

### ➤ MCP Tool Definition

```python
# mcp_compliance_server.py

from mcp import MCPServer, tool
import requests

API_KEY = "super-secret-token"
SaaS_API_URL = "https://api.acmecompliance.com/check"

server = MCPServer(name="ComplianceMCP")

@tool(name="compliance_check", description="Check if a company or individual is on sanctions or watchlists.")
def compliance_check(entity_name: str):
    """
    Sends the entity name to AcmeCompliance SaaS API.
    """
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    payload = {
        "entity_name": entity_name
    }
    response = requests.post(SaaS_API_URL, json=payload, headers=headers)
    result = response.json()

    # Return a clean structured response
    return {
        "entity": entity_name,
        "found_on_watchlist": result["is_sanctioned"],
        "details": result.get("details", "")
    }

if __name__ == "__main__":
    server.run()
```

---

## ✅ How Partner Uses It

Partner’s agent sends:

```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "compliance_check",
    "arguments": {
      "entity_name": "Acme Widgets"
    }
  }
}
```

Your MCP server:

* checks the token
* calls your SaaS API:

  ```
  POST https://api.acmecompliance.com/check
  Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
  ```
* returns a safe JSON payload.

Partner receives:

```json
{
  "entity": "Acme Widgets",
  "found_on_watchlist": false,
  "details": ""
}
```

---

## ✅ Why Use MCP Server Instead of REST?

✅ **LLM integration**

* Partners plug this directly into agent frameworks like:

  * OpenAI Agents SDK
  * Anthropic Claude MCP
  * LangChain
* Your tool appears automatically in agent tool discovery.

✅ **Standard interface**

* No partner-specific SDKs needed.
* One tool = many partner integrations.

✅ **Security & control**

* You can enforce:

  * authentication
  * rate limiting
  * usage auditing

✅ **Natural language use cases**

* Partners can simply say:

  > “Check if Elon Musk is on any sanctions list.”
* And your MCP Server handles the query under the hood.

## ✅ Security in Production

For real-world deployment:

✅ Require API tokens
✅ Check quotas & rate limits
✅ Mask sensitive info from logs
✅ Consider running the MCP server behind a WAF or API Gateway
✅ Support **SSE transport** if offering remote MCP hosting

---

# TL;DR

✅ **Yes — an external compliance SaaS can run its own MCP Server.**
✅ You expose tools, not raw APIs.
✅ Partners call your MCP server → you forward to your SaaS APIs.
✅ Safer, scalable, and highly LLM-friendly.
