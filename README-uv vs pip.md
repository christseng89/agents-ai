# UV vs PIP

## ✅ Why `uv` is faster than `pip`

[`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a **next-generation Python package manager** designed to be much faster and more efficient than `pip`, `virtualenv`, and `pip-tools` combined.

Here are the **main reasons why `uv` is faster**:

---

### 🚀 1. **Written in Rust (not Python)**

* `uv` is built in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), a compiled systems language.
* It has better performance characteristics than `pip`, which is written in Python.
* Rust code runs natively and efficiently, with zero startup overhead.

> 💡 Similar to how `npm` → `bun` or `yarn` → `pnpm` showed speed improvements when rewritten in Rust or Go.

---

### ⚙️ 2. **Parallelized resolution and downloading**

* `uv` does **parallel dependency resolution and fetching**.
* `pip` processes packages sequentially (1-by-1).
* Result: `uv` can resolve hundreds of packages in seconds.

---

### 💡 3. **Built-in resolver and installer**

* `uv` **doesn't shell out** to external tools like `pip`, `pip-compile`, or `virtualenv`.
* It handles **all steps (resolve, lock, install)** in a single fast pipeline.

---

### 📦 4. **Aggressively caches everything**

* `uv` caches package metadata, wheels, and resolutions.
* Even the first install is fast; repeated installs are blazing fast.
* Supports caching like:

  ```
  ~/.cache/uv/
  ```

---

### 🧩 5. **Uses compiled wheels directly**

* `uv` prefers wheels and avoids building from source if possible.
* `pip` often tries to build from `sdist` (especially if no wheel available), which is slow.

## 🔬 Real-world benchmark (from Astral)

| Tool  | Install 300+ packages |
| ----- | --------------------- |
| `pip` | \~25–45 seconds       |
| `uv`  | \~1–2 seconds         |

⚠️ Depending on internet, wheel availability, and whether cache is warm.

## ✅ Summary: Key Technical Differences

| Feature             | `pip`                | `uv`                   |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Language            | Python               | Rust                   |
| Parallel resolution | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes                  |
| Compiled binary     | ❌ (interpreted)      | ✅ (compiled)           |
| Built-in venv       | ❌ Needs `virtualenv` | ✅ Native venv support  |
| Cache & reuse       | Basic                | Aggressive, persistent |
| Speed               | Slower               | ⚡ Blazing fast         |

If you're doing CI/CD, monorepo setups, or just tired of long `pip install` times — `uv` is a great drop-in alternative.
